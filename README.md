# gmail-purger
gmail is almost full, time to cleanup:
- using python and gmail api
- get all the  email senders  in your email account
- identify sender's whose email you can discard entirely or by date range
- delete email by sender by date range
- I will be using poetry, @see [poetry_readme.md](poetry_readme.md)
